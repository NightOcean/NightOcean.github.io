							<h1>Profile</h1>
							<p>Hi! My name is Kelvin Tran, and I was born in Melbourne, Australia. I usually speak English most of the time, but I can speak Vietnamese to a certain degree where I can have simple conversations. I have finished and graduated from Highschool, Year Twelve back in 2019. In 2021, I am taking my first year of Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT.<br>
							An interesting fact about myself is that one of the things I like to do is to surf online and look at trivial matters that not a lot of people pay attention to since it is irrelevant to them.<br>
							A hobby I take in my spare time is playing online games such as Apex Legends or PSO2. I also play indie games that not a lot of people play but rather I play them because of the dramatic story they give or the unique visuals that they give.</p>

								<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
								<p>My interest in IT starts all the way from using my first computer back in early 2008 and it just hits me with many questions such as how computers perform basic tasks to advance tasks to please its users and continues to improve itself better as technology advances into the future. So, I like to be a software developer that can make simple applications that can be used for everyday leisure that anyone can happily enjoy using.</p>
								<p>I am currently taking a Bachelor of Information Technology (2021 to 2023) at RMIT University. While there are various reasons, I decided to go for RMIT University because of the strong reputation for its technology courses and due to how accessible it is.</p>
								<p>I am hoping to gain many opportunities to develop skills and experiences that could prepare me for the future such as programming in many coding languages, as well as networking and database design. I believe that this would be a great pathway for me to take on my way as to be a Software developer.</p>

							<h3>Description</h3>
							<p>A full-time position as a Software Developer that focuses on various areas such as Data & Analytics, Digital, Cloud & Technology, Customer Engagement, Artificial Intelligence and Cyber Security while engaging both independently and as a team.</p>
							<p>This is an appealing position as I like to collaborate with others as a team in projects, and it involves a range of technologies used to develop many products. Because there are many roles, it will lead me to believe that the job does not focus on one particular area but in variety application.</p>
							<h3>Skills I Need:</h3>
							<li>Experiences in and learn multiple programming languages and libraries that will allow me to be flexible in understanding the work.</li>
							<li>A strong mindset that thinks towards the consumers/users</li>
							<li>Experience in Web-structure design</li>
							<h3>Skills I currently have that is relevant:</h3>

							<li>Computer literacy</li>
							<li>Problem Solving</li>
							<h3>Learning Plan:</h3>
							<p>In terms of obtaining these skills would be done through my bachelor’s degree of Information Technology and take on a traineeship or multiple volunteer work to gain a better understanding of what I’ve grasp and put into work situations. Because this is a technology related job, I would also have to adapt to new future updates on both software and hardware including other technology trends as it could be either more convenient or more complex for users to learn.</p>

							<h2>Personality</h2>
							<h3>The following personal profile test I have taken are:</h3>
							<ol>
								<li>Myers-Briggs test</li>
								<li>Life Train – Learning Styles Quiz </li>
								<li>Big Five Personality Test</li>
							</ol>
							<h3>About the results:</h3>
							<p>The results reflect that I am confident with my interacting abilities in a group and that I tend to think logically rather than let my emotions control my answer. I am also careful with my words of choice or decision to not upset others and am open to other people’s opinions. My approach to learning comes from having experiences to relate to what I am being taught. While I believe that is somewhat true, I also learn from my peers and researching the topic. An interesting thing I found is that while I can see myself as all these types of traits. I do not however can show them all at once.</p>
							<h3>How I feel it may affect my behaviour in a team:</h3>
								<p>Although, I never really think of myself as a leader type or the one who pushes others forth as the dominant one so I believe that these Personal Profile test cannot really be taken for guarantee, however I like to view myself as someone who can be approachable and be a helping hand on equal terms that will not drag the team down.<br>
								I think I would be an irreplaceable teammate due to my outgoing personality as it can be a source of motivation for the group and that I like to see objectives or challenges as a way to bring the team together.
								</p>
							<h3>How I take this into account when forming a team:</h3>
							<p>I have concluded that the three results tell me that I should aim to find or make a reliable team that does not force too many pressures on one person and that it will be better to share the burden equally. If both myself and my team know each other strengths and weakness, then they can help cover the areas to improve my weakness and utilise our strength to its best potential. I also believe that I will probably not work best with someone who would be too demanding and lacks the understanding of other members around them with their certain conditions.</p>

				<!-- Project Idea-->
					<section id="project" class="wrapper style3 fade-up">
						<div class="inner">
							<h2>My Project Idea</h2>
							<h3>Overview</h3>
							<p>As for a project idea that I am willing to create, I like to develop a game with the title of it being temporary called “Soul Companion” with it being in a format of a Pixel Role Playing Game with a mix of puzzle and explorations. However, the player you control in the game will have self-awareness, knowing that you exist to control them and that what you do determines their outcome or so to say, fate.</p>
							<h3>Motivation</h3>
							<p>This would be an interesting project to take as I have prior experiences in making games using GameMaker or Clickteam Fusion. While I have not created a full game before, I have done small prototypes in the past where I did every role by myself such as creating the stage or level, creating the sprite & animations, creating sound & music, play test, debugging errors and trying to motivate myself to do all of this for the desire to enjoy playing games as a gamer, which I believe is a well worth commitment to take. As a solo enthusiastic game developer, I just love to try out things in every perspective regardless of if it is easy or difficult. <br>
							I believe that making this game can be considered as playing the game at the same time, as you are developing the story in a way that you would enjoy it as both a developer and gamer’s perspective.</p>
							<h3>Description</h3>
							<p>The project “Soul Companion” is a game program that will be made using Game Maker and would be operated on Windows OS as a .exe file, with potential future options for porting to MacOS and Linux, once the initial development is complete.</p>
							<p>The user finds themselves controlling the player in a garbage dump that would seem to be silent at first but will later start to communicate more and open up to the user as you journey together in a mysterious devastated world with a population less than a few hundred thousand.</p>
							<p>The user will be given no plot directions outside of just instructions on how to play the game. The game will simply, or more specifically the player will tell you that they will unconsciously want to interact more with you and the objects or people around them. If there is a main focus, then it would be that you, the user must help the player survive.</p>
							<p>You can move the player through key inputs such as ASWD and will be able to use action or special commands that the user can ask the player to do or respond, such as interacting with objects or people. The user will also have the option to rekey bind their controls depending on their preferences in the menu settings.</p>
							<p>Action commands can be like interact, accept, decline, and will depend on the situation you are in the game.</p>
							<p>An example of a special command is that you can ask the player how they are feeling right now, or to dance to the background music that only you can hear.</p>
							<p>In this game, there is no such thing as game overs. So, when you come across a difficult situation, the player will prompt the user to just retry into they complete it. However, there will be situations where your choices are permanent, and you will never be able to go back again unless you start from the very beginning. These choices will not really cause a grave error on your end and will not affect your overall experience with the player.</p>
							<p>While the target audience is for anybody who enjoy games in general, it is aimed towards those who enjoy solving puzzles and being a part of the story that would test the bonds between the user and the player. You will also enjoy this game if you like to interact with the player and help them solve their problem.</p>
							<p>I like to mention that there is actually no story given but more like you imagine your own story which is the journey you have with the player as you travel from place to place.</p>
							<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
							<p>The software, hardware, and equipment the project would need are:</p>
							<p> - The program I would use to make the game would be Game Maker as it is quite beginner friendly. (Other options could be Open RPG Maker, Clickteam Fusion or Unity) <br>
								- While most of the components can be made in Game Maker, we would also need a music production software that can create sound effects and music such as some few free recommendations are:</p>
									<li>LMMS - <a href="https://lmms.io/" class="label">https://lmms.io/</span></a></li>
									<li>Bfxr - <a href="https://www.bfxr.net/" class="label">https://www.bfxr.net/</span></a></li>
									<li>Famitracker <a href="http://famitracker.com/" class="label">http://famitracker.com/</span></a></li><br>
								<p>- Some good viable pixel art software:</p>
									<li>Krita - <a href="https://krita.org/en" class="label">https://krita.org/en/</span></a></li>
									<li>Gimp - <a href="https://www.gimp.org" class="label">https://www.gimp.org/</span></a></li>
									<li>GraphicsGale - <a href="https://graphicsgale.com/us" class="label">https://graphicsgale.com/us</span></a></li>
							<h3>Skills Required</h3>
							<P>For the project, Soul Companion to run and execute as a game I intend it to be, would need the following: <br>
								- Revisit and improve my skills in using the GameMaker Language. <br>
								- Be committed to teach others and gain critical feedback to help improve each other.<br>
								- Have a strong and unique creative mind. <br>
								- Be in the shoes of the users playing the game. <br>
							<p>These can all be achievable by simply just having a strong passion to make or play games. The softwares listed above are all free to use, and even if using a different OS, it will not be that difficult to import to another OS type.</p>
							<h3>Outcome</h3>
							<p>If this game is completed, or a prototype version featuring the interactions made by you (The user) and the player throughout the story, the end results would show that you have a connection with the player, no matter how it turns out. Because this is a game, the users would normally follow instructions on how to play the game and progress through, my intentions are that I want the users to find out by themselves by connecting with the player that they are controlling, and that they will share a bond that only they would know of. The impact of this development is that the user would empathise with the player by helping them, and in return will make the user feel satisfied</p>
